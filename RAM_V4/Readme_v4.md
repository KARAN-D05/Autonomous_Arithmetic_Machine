# Repeated Arithmetic Machine - V4

## About
- Programmable Stored instruction system
- Instructions in machine code are stored in memory and are executed sequentially
- Instead of manually controlling each operation, v4 can now load and execute a sequence of instructions stored in memory.

## Features
- A memory unit to store the program
- Can sequentially execute multiple instructions without any intervention
- Each instruction is 16 bit long
- The memory can be made as large as possible after interfacing sufficient number of memory subcircuits.
- Program have to be loaded initially through load pins in machine code
- Supports all operations 

## Purpose
- This version continues the self initiated exploration of how compuation evolves from logic gates to programmable-machines
- It bridges gap between data processing(v3) and instruction processing(v4)
