## About the Repeated Arithmetic Machine

This project began from a simple curiosity: what if the output of an arithmetic operation could be fed back into the input? 

The first prototype was very basic — it could only perform addition and take feedback. But as I explored the possibilities, I
kept improving the machine:

- Added **subtraction** and LED indicators to show which outputs were correct.  
- Developed a **2's complement output form corrector** to handle negative results.  
- Introduced a **comparator** to automate corrections when B > A, removing the need for manual adjustments.  
- Implemented **multiplication**,**Division** convergence detectors, and other logic for advanced operations.
- Enhanced the system with **self-correcting features, self-awareness, and automatic halting** to prevent data corruption.  

Through each iteration, the goal was simple: make the machine **smarter, more autonomous, and more reliable**.  

Today, the Repeated Arithmetic Machine is a modular, 4-bit arithmetic computing system with feedback-driven control, automation, and error handling — a full evolution from a simple prototype to a fully autonomous, intelligent machine.
