# Repeated Arithmetic Machine - Engine

## About
The very first implementation of the Repeated arithmetic machine idea.

## Features
- Basic repeated arithmetic (addition & subtraction)
- Manual feedback, output, input, mode and reset pin

## Limitations
- No error correction
- No overflow detection

## Significance
- It was a proof of concept that repeated arithmetic and feedback could form basis of a machine.

## Instructions to use
- Input the values of A and B usign selector pin.
- you can feed the output using feedback pin, feedback comes in B.

## How to Run This Project

1. **Install Logisim Evolution**
   - Download and install from: [Logisim Evolution GitHub](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution)

2. **Clone or Download the Repository** 
   - To clone via Git (recommended):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/KARAN-D05/Autonomous_Arithmetic_Machine.git
     ```
   - Or download ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

3. **Open the Circuit File** 
   - Open Logisim Evolution. 
   - Navigate to the project folder and open any `.circ` file (e.g., `r_a_mEngine.circ` for version 1).

4. **Simulate the Machine** 
   - Use the input pins and observe the output. 
   - Follow any instructions in the README for specific versions.

5. **Optional: Explore Other Versions** 
   - Later versions (`r_a_mv1.circ`, `r_a_mv2.circ`, `r_a_mv3.circ`) include more advanced automation and self-correction.
